# Todo-List <br /><br />
## What does it do? <br />
Title explains everything. It's a Todo-List. <br />
User can input things to do in a space and press enter to add list. <br/>
By clicking check box in the list to draw a line on the item to show work is done. <br/>
Once user completed an item and wants to delete a specific item, simply double-click to remove the item. <br/>
If user wants to remove the whole list, click 'Delete All' button to do so. <br/>
User's location shows up on the top. <br/>
Background will change depending on user's location and weather. <br/>
Stores lists into local storage to speed up the load and store list data. <br/><br/>
## Things Learned <br />
- Gained understanding of what DOM (Document Object Model) is and how to manipulate data with it <br />
